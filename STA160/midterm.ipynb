    "Throughout our analysis, we will be using a large data of Asteroids - NeoWs. We will discusses the factors that might be usefull to identify an asteroid as potentially hazardous or not. Also we will explains the classification power of those remaining factors in the absence of absolute magnitude and minimum orbit intersection values. \n",

    "Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earthâ€™s neighborhood. The scientific interest in comets and asteroids is due largely to their status as the relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system formation process some 4.6 billion years ago. As the primitive, leftover building blocks of the solar system formation process, comets and asteroids offer clues to the chemical mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. "
